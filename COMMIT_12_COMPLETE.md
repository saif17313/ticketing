# ‚úÖ COMMIT 12 COMPLETED: Seat Selection & Booking System

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Branch:** main

---

## üìã Summary

Successfully implemented a complete **Seat Selection & Booking System** for passengers. The system includes visual seat selection, passenger details form, booking confirmation, booking management, and seat locking mechanism to prevent race conditions.

**Key Achievement:** Used **existing database schema** (migrations already created on 2025-10-19) instead of creating new ones, adapting the implementation to match existing structure.

## üìù Important Notes

### **Schema Adaptation:**
- **Original Commit 12 Plan:** Proposed creating `booking_seats` pivot table
- **Actual Implementation:** Used existing `seats` table with per-schedule seat records
- **Key Difference:** Seats exist per schedule (not shared), with `booking_id` linking to booking
- **Advantage:** Simpler schema, supports seat locking with `locked_until` field

### **Seat Generation:**
- Seats are **auto-generated** when first user opens seat selection for a schedule
- Generation logic:
  - If `bus.seat_layout == '2x2'`: Generate A1, B1, C1, D1, A2, B2... (4 per row)
  - Else: Generate S1, S2, S3... (simple numbering)
- Seats stored in `seats` table with status `available`

### **Payment Integration:**
- Currently: "Pay at counter" for both booking types
- Future: Online payment gateway integration
- Payment model ready for future use

### **PDF Ticket Generation:**
- Button exists: "Download Ticket (Coming Soon)"
- Future feature: Generate PDF with booking details, QR code, etc.
