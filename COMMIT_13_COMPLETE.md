**Status:** ✅ CORE FEATURES COMPLETE  
**Branch:** main

---

## 📋 Summary

Successfully implemented **Payment Integration System** with multiple payment methods (bKash, Nagad, Rocket, Card) and **Booking Expiry Automation** with scheduled command to auto-expire unpaid bookings.

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### **1. Payment Controller Created**

#### ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Passenger/PaymentController.php`
- **Purpose:** Handle all payment operations
- **Methods (6):**
  1. `showPaymentOptions($booking)` - Payment method selection page
  2. `processMobilePayment(Request, $booking)` - Handle bKash/Nagad/Rocket
  3. `processCardPayment(Request, $booking)` - Handle card payments
  4. `showSuccess($booking)` - Payment success confirmation
  5. `downloadInvoice($booking)` - Invoice download (HTML for now)
  6. `detectCardType($number)` - Helper to detect Visa/Mastercard/Amex

**Key Features:**
- User ownership verification (only pay own bookings)
- Booking status check (only pending bookings)
- Expiry validation
- 90% success rate simulation for mobile payments
- Transaction creation with unique transaction_id
- Booking status update (pending → confirmed)
- Payment details stored as JSON

---

### **2. Booking Expiry Command Created**

#### ✅ `app/Console/Commands/ExpireBookings.php`
- **Purpose:** Scheduled command to expire unpaid bookings
- **Command:** `php artisan bookings:expire`
- **Schedule:** Runs every hour

**Functionality:**
1. Finds bookings with:
   - `status = 'pending'`
   - `booking_type = 'book'`
   - `expires_at < now()`
2. For each expired booking:
   - Releases all seats (status → available)
   - Increments schedule available_seats
   - Updates booking status to 'expired'
   - Logs expiry event
3. Outputs summary:
   - ✅ Successfully expired count
   - ❌ Failed count (if any)
   - 📅 Timestamp

**Usage:**
```bash
# Manual test
php artisan bookings:expire

# Run scheduler (development)
php artisan schedule:work

# Production (add to cron)
* * * * * cd /path/to/project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

---

### **3. Scheduler Registration**

#### ✅ `routes/console.php` - Updated
- Registered command to run hourly
- Laravel 11 style (no Kernel.php file)

```php
Schedule::command('bookings:expire')->hourly();
```

---

### **4. Payment Views Created (2 files)**

#### ✅ `resources/views/passenger/payment/options.blade.php`
- **Purpose:** Payment method selection interface
- **Features:**
  - Expiry warning (if booking has expires_at)
  - 4 Payment method cards:
    - 📱 bKash (pink hover)
    - 💸 Nagad (orange hover)
    - 🚀 Rocket (purple hover)
    - 💳 Card (blue hover)
  - Booking summary sidebar (sticky)
  - Mobile payment modal (for bKash/Nagad/Rocket):
    - Mobile number input (01XXXXXXXXX validation)
    - PIN input (4-6 digits)
    - Cancel/Pay buttons
  - Card payment modal:
    - Card number (13-19 digits)
    - Cardholder name
    - Expiry (MM/YYYY)
    - CVV (3 digits)
  - JavaScript for modal handling
  - Click outside to close modal

**Design:** Professional payment gateway style, large clickable cards

#### ✅ `resources/views/passenger/payment/success.blade.php`
- **Purpose:** Payment success confirmation page
- **Features:**
  - Animated checkmark (SVG with stroke animation)
  - Confetti animation (CSS + JavaScript)
  - Bounce animation on success icon
  - Booking details card with green border
  - Transaction details display
  - Action buttons:

### **5. Routes Added (5 routes)**

#### ✅ `routes/web.php` - Updated

**Payment Routes (auth + role:passenger):**
```php
GET  /passenger/booking/{booking}/payment     - Payment options page
POST /passenger/payment/mobile/{booking}      - Process mobile payment
POST /passenger/payment/card/{booking}        - Process card payment
GET  /passenger/payment/success/{booking}     - Payment success page
GET  /passenger/booking/{booking}/invoice     - Download invoice (future)
```

---

### **6. Booking Flow Updated**

#### ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Passenger/BookingController.php` - Modified
- **Change:** `confirmBooking()` method updated
- **New Logic:**
  ```php
  if ($bookingType === 'direct_pay') {
      // Redirect to payment page
      return redirect()->route('passenger.booking.payment', $booking);
  } else {
      // Booking complete (pay later)
      return redirect()->route('passenger.bookings.show', $booking);
  }
  ```

**Updated Flow:**
```
Old: Search → Seats → Details → Confirm → Booking Show
New: Search → Seats → Details → Confirm → Payment (if direct_pay) → Success
```
